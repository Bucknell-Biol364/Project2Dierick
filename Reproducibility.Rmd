So we found two main papers to focus on for reproducibility. The first one is a review(kind of) of repeatability of published microarray gene expression analyses. This paper (labeled "out.pdf") in our repo, looked at 18 different papers, with the Dierick paper listed at number 16. The figure that was randomly selected was table 2, and the reproducibility stated that the raw data was not given, but the processed data was. Overall, the review paper determined that table 2 was able to be reproduced, with some discrepancies. They stated things like, "expression fold change values being inconsistant". What was really interesting about this paper was that one team of analysts for the Dierick paper table 2 described it was "cannot reproduce", while another team described it as "can reproduce partially with some discrepancies", so it's interesting that there seemed to be a pretty significant issue with that data/the table that was produced. I would've liked them to try figure 2, which is what we had such a big problem with (potential p hacking) - but the assignemnt of figures/tables to reproduce was randomized.

The paper "A common genetic target for environmental and heritable influences on aggressiveness in Drosophila" didn't necessarily reproduce the exact study itself but the experiments within that paper confirmed some of the results regarding a specific gene in Drosophila that the original Dierick paper found.

Overall I think that the Dierick paper has some serious issues with the design itself but perhaps got lucky in their ending conclusion/results that the same result was supported in other studies. I would really like to see figure 2 reproduced, or at least an attempt at it. The Dierick paper was also cited around 160 times from google scholar, so I bet if I go down the aggressive fly rabbit hole I could find later studies (maybe 2010 and more recent) that found issues with the data itself and results.
